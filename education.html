            Hello guys, this page contains details about my education and how do I look at studies as an individual. Where I have had my education,it is all listed in the section given below. Here I will first discuss my education journey, what behaviour I had towards academics, what I did at various level of education and all stuff related to that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Surely, education is something on which almost every Indian parent focuses a lot. I don't oppose them, they are right somewhere but what I feel is that one should go with his/her passion. There are many examples out there who proves it, like you can take Kapil Sharma, a man who charges 20 lakhs for each show just by doing interaction in front of the crowd. And the average salary of a software developer in India is Rs 5 lakhs "annually". So the difference is surely quite large. But what we are ignoring here is that, we are comparing the best comedian of our country to an average software developer. There are about 2.75 million software developers in India, and an average salary of 5 lakh now seems a lot better. So what point I am trying to make here is that, if you want to follow your passion, then bring the best out of it to make sure that your work is spectacular, otherwise, put your efforts in something which has maximum possibility of getting successful and follow your passion side by side to make yourself happy and satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of my journey, I enjoyed my childhood to fullest, by never worrying much about studies. I tried many different things like I used to do painting which I liked the most, I played football which is the best game ever for me, I did clay modelling and I really used to make really nice models, but at the end, I got interested in studies (it was from 8th-9th standard, the best time to become serious about studies), got competitive with my classmates and finally ended up here.

            It was my first school so I don't remember much about it. It was located in the middle of fields, so I used to enjoy the journey by bus from home to school and then back to home a lot. The teachers there were very friendly and charming. I studied there from Nursey to 2nd standard and had a overall nice experience.

            This was the school where I collected my best memories. It offers many co-curricular activities where you can learn many new things, know your talent and groom yourself to the best. The teachers here are very friendly (but become strict when time comes) and I found many nice friends here. I was there from my 3rd standard to 10th standard and had my best time here as a child.

            So this was the school where I put my maximum and did a lot of hard work. Teachers are awesome here, the competition is tough and the curriculam is very strict. This school will bring out the maximum potential out of you. It is one of the best schools in Rewari city. However, it is quite expensive because it charges a heavy amount of fee. It is more study oriented, and don't focuses much on extra curricular activities

            I must say that it is the best coaching institute for JEE preperation in Sikar. With a strong faculty, headed by Mr. Kapil Dhaka, Mr. Anil Gora and Mr. Narender Kok, this academy offers a strong competition which is best suited for your preperation. I personally suggest this institute for JEE preperation because Sikar is quite a nice city, neither it is too crowded like Kota, water quality is good and the fees of this academy is also not too high.

            IIT Roorkee is one of the best engineering college in India. Located in Uttrakhand, it has many nice places to visit nearby. It has a nice coding culture with students competiting in International coding competitions. It offers you the best opportunities to find your talent and enhance it. However, the course structure here is a little old and needs to be reformed.
